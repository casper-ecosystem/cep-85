## casper-cep85-js-client

This package was created to help JS/TS users with the [cep-85](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep-85) and is published in `npm` as the [casper-cep85-js-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/casper-cep85-js-client). It was built on top of the [casper-js-sdk](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/casper-js-sdk).

This JavaScript client gives you an easy way to install and interact with the Casper CEP-85 contract.
Users can treat this package as a deploy builder for all of these possible interactions:

- contract installation including different configurations
- token minting
- token transfers
- token burning
- batch actions
- approvals of operators
- changing security configurations after installation
- setting collection/tokens uri
- getting some of the contract-related data

## Usage

1. To install, run:

   `npm i -S casper-cep85-js-client`

2. Import the contract in your code:

   `import { CEP85Client } from 'casper-cep85-js-client'`

3. If you want to install it, look at the `install` method and all of the possible configuration options (`InstallArgs`).

4. If you want to start working with a previously installed contract, use the `setContractHash(contractHash)` method.

NOTE: Since version `1.3` both `casper-js-sdk` and `@make-software/ces-js-parser` are peer dependencies. If you are using npm version `<7` you may need to install both dependencies manually.

## Prepare

Running `npm run wasms:convert` will copy cep-85 contract wasm file to `/wasm/` folder

## Examples

As a good starting point, you can look into the [TUTORIAL](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/TUTORIAL.md) and the `examples/` directory to see the most common usage scenarios (`install.ts` and `usage.ts`). You can install the contract and run the example scenario by running the `npm run example:install` and `npm run example:usage`. You will need to specify environment variables, preferebly in a `client-js/.env` file. Here are some example values for the environment variables that need to be specified:

```
NODE_URL=http://localhost:11101/rpc
NETWORK_NAME=casper-net-1
MASTER_KEY_PAIR_PATH=/Users/someuser/.casper/casper-node/utils/nctl/assets/net-1/faucet
USER1_KEY_PAIR_PATH=/Users/someuser/.casper/casper-node/utils/nctl/assets/net-1/users/user-1
```

## Development

Before installing the node modules, make sure the contract Wasm is generated by running the following at root folder of the cep-85:

```bash
make build-contract
```

After generating the Wasm file, you can install the node modules, and the Wasm will be automatically bundled.

```bash
cd client-js
npm install && npm run wasms:convert
```

## Testing

Run Integration tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Events Handling

As CEP-85 1.0 supports one events modes - `CES` we have one parsers as a part of this SDK.

- Example usage of CES parser

```
import { EventStream, EventName, CasperServiceByJsonRPC } from 'casper-js-sdk';
import { CESEventParserFactory } from 'casper-cep85-js-sdk';

const casperClient = new CasperServiceByJsonRPC(NODE_URL);

const cesEventParser = CESEventParserFactory({
  contractHashes: [contractHash],
  casperClient,
});

const es = new EventStream(EVENT_STREAM_ADDRESS);
es.subscribe(EventName.DeployProcessed, async (event) => {
  const parsedEvents = await cesEventParser(event);

  if (parsedEvents?.success) {
    console.log(parsedEvents.data);
  }
});
es.start();
```
